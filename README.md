Context: Many individuals with mobility impairments face challenges in navigating websites and
interacting with digital interfaces. Traditional input methods like a keyboard and mouse may not be
accessible for users with physical disabilities. Voice-controlled interfaces offer a solution by allowing
users to navigate and interact with websites hands-free, ensuring greater accessibility and
independence.

Problem: Despite advancements in technology, many websites and applications remain inaccessible
to users with disabilities. While assistive tools like screen readers and voice assistants exist, there is a
lack of web interfaces that are fully optimized for voice control. This limits the ability of individuals
with physical disabilities to engage in tasks such as browsing the web, filling forms, and accessing
information independently. The lack of intuitive voice-controlled navigation tools hinders inclusivity
and denies equal access to digital content for disabled users.

Develop a Voice-Controlled UI that enables disabled users to navigate websites and interact
with key elements (e.g., buttons, links, forms) using simple voice commands. This web application will be equipped
with a voice recognition system that interprets user commands like "Go to home," "Fill form," or "Submit," allowing
for hands-free navigation and interaction. The solution will enhance web accessibility by making digital content
easier to navigate for users with limited mobility.
